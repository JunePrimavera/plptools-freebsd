.SH NAME
psidump \- This is an example of a sample man page
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B psidump
.B [-Vvfi]
.BI "[-D " disk ]
.BI "[-m " mount_dir ]
.BI "[-d " dump_dir ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I psidump
is a command to back up files from a psion or EPOC machine to your linux box.
By default, it will only backup those files that have changed since it
was last backed up.

All backups are stored in their own separate files, and a directory is
maintained which contains the latest version of all files on the system.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-V
Display the version and exit
.TP
.B \-v
Produce verbose logging output.
.TP
.B \-f
This option forces a full back up to be done, rather than just backing up
the files that have changed since the last backup.
.TP
.B \-i
Performs an incremental back up - only backs up the files that have
changed since the last backup.  This is the default.
.TP
.BI "\-D " disk(s)
Specify the psion disks to be backed up.  This defaults to the 'C' and
'D' drives.  For reasons of completeness, the 'Z' (ROM drive) can also
be specified for backup (but there probably isn't any need to - unless
you plan to do unspeakable things to the insides of you psion!!).
.TP
.BI "\-m " mount_dir
Specify the mount directory.  This defaults to the directory specified
is your psion configuration - usually /mnt/psion.
.TP
.BI "\-d " dump_dir
Specify the dump directory.  This defaults to $HOME/psion/backups.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
$HOME/psion
Default directory where psion psion configuration and dump information
is stored.
.TP
$HOME/psion/etc
Configuration information about your psion(s) is stored here.
.TP
$HOME/psion/backups
All backups are stored under this directory.

.SH FILES
All files that are used are located in $HOME/psion.  The directories
are:
.TP
$HOME/psion/etc/psitab
This file is a table of the different EPOC machines which have connected
to this machine.  The first entry is the machine id, and the second
entry is the machine name.
Note that there must be a <tab> between the two fields!                                           
Any lins starting with a '#' are comments.
