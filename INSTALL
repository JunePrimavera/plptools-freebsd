Installation instructions for plptools
--------------------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------

To build plpfuse, the following packages are required:

  FUSE: http://fuse.sourceforge.net/
  libattr: ftp://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/download/

These packages come with most Linux distributions. To build plptools,
the development packages (typically ending in -dev or -devel) must be
installed. If they are not installed, plpfuse will not be built, but
the rest of plptools will still work.


Installation
------------

plptools uses GNU autotools, so the usual sequence of commands works:

./configure
make
make install

In addition to the usual options, configure understands the following:

  --enable-debug

       builds debugging versions of the programs and libplp

  --with-serial=/dev/sometty

       sets the default serial device for ncpd. Without this option,
       ncpd tries automagically to find a serial device.

  --with-speed=baudrate

       sets the default serial speed (normally 115200 baud).

  --with-port=portnum

       sets the default port on which ncpd listens and to which plpftp
       and plpfuse connect (default 7501).

  --with-drive=drivespec

       sets the default drive for plpftp. The default "AUTO"
       triggers a drive-scan on the psion and sets the drive to the
       first drive found. If you don't want that, specify "C:" for
       example.

  --with-basedir=dirspec

       overrides the default directory for plpftp. The default is \
       which means the root directory. Note: since backslashes need to
       be doubled once for C escaping and once for shell escaping,
       this value is actually supplied as "\\\\".


Information for developers
--------------------------

To build from git, you will first need to run

 autoreconf -i

To make a release automatically, you need woger, from
