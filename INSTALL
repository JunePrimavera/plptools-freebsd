Basic Installation
 $Id$

 How to install:

 ./configure
 make
 make install

 In addition to the usual options, configure understands the following
 stuff for customization to your environment:

  --enable-debug

       Adds -g to CFLAGS, so you will get debugging-versions of
       the programs and libplp

  --with-serial=/dev/sometty

       overrides the default serial device for ncpd. Without this
       option, configure tries to automagically find a serial device.

  --with-speed=baudrate

       overrides the default serial speed of 115200 baud.

  --with-port=portnum

       overrides the default port number, where ncpd listens
       and plpftp resp. plpnfsd connects to.

  --with-drive=drivespec

       overrides the default drive for plpftp. The default "AUTO"
       triggers a drive-scan on the psion and sets the drive to
       the first drive found. If you don't want that, specify
       C: for example.

  --with-basedir=dirspec

       overrides the default directory for plpftp. The default is \\
       which means the root-dir. Note: directory-separators have to
       be specified as C-like backslashes and if you consider shell's
       escape-mechanism, these in turn have to be escaped with backslashes ;-)

  --disable-mnttab

       By default, configure checks for existence of /etc/mtab or /etc/mnttab
       and configures plpnfsd to update that file every time when it
       mounts or unmounts the psion. If plpnfsd crashes or is killed during
       that update, /etc/mtab resp. /etc/mnttab can be corrupted. Since
       this file on some operating systems is vital for functionality
       of mount/umount, this update can be disabled with the above option.

  --enable-kde

       Enable build of KDE related stuff. This needs installed
       KDE (>= 2) headers/development-libraries as well as QT (>= 2.2.4)
       headers/development-libraries.

  --with-kdedir=/path/to/your/kde

       Specify the KDE directory. I got several reports from SuSE users,
       who have KDE1 and KDE2 in those weird pathes /opt/kde and /opt/kde2
       installed and the automatic detection does get confused by that.
       So be shure to use this switch. RedHat users can safely use
       --prefix=/usr instead.

  --with-qt-dir=/path/to/your/qtdir

   or 

  --with-qt-includes=/path/to/your/qt-headers
  --with-qt-libraries=/path/to/your/qt-lib

      Same as above. Use these, when automatic detection fails.

  --with-kdeversion=X

       Override the KDE version detection manually. Only needed in
       special cases where more than one KDE version is installed and
       autodetection fails. X can be either 2 or 3.

 By default, the install-prefix is /usr/local, so you probably
 should add /usr/local/lib to your /etc/ld.so.conf and then run
 ldconfig after installation. Another option is to run configure
 with the option --prefix=/usr

 NOTE:
 Although the subdirectory for KDE stuff is named "kde2", this is only
 for historical reason. The package builds on KDE 3 as well as KDE 2.
 It tries to figure out the version of KDE automatically. People who have
 both versions installed should carefully watch the output of configure.
 The KDEDIR as well as KDE's version can be overridden via commandline
 (see above).

 KDE STUFF

 The KDE KIOslave library adds support for a new protocol named
 "psion:". So in konqueror, just open psion:/ to see your Psion's
 drives. You now can copy, move, rename, open ... all those
 operations you are used to. Any KDE application which supports
 URLs should be able to deal with the files on the Psion.
 If you have the toplevel directory displayed in Konqueror, the
 Property dialog for the drives (right-click on an icon of a
 drive, Properties) comes up in a modified fashion which allows
 you to see the drive usage as well as triggering backup, restore
 and format. The toplevel Properties (right-click on the view's
 background, Properties) brings up a Dialog which displays machine-
 related information. (Same info like the "machinfo" command in
 plpftp. Currently there are no mime-types for Psion-Files but i
 soon will add these. Backup, restore and format is done by a separate
 standalone program "KPsion".

Have fun.
