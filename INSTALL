Basic Installation
 $Id$

 How to install:

 ./configure
 make
 make install

 In addition to the usual options, configure understands the following
 stuff for customization to your environment:

  --enable-debug

       Adds -g to CFLAGS, so you will get debugging-versions of
       the programs and libplp

  --with-serial=/dev/sometty

       overrides the default serial device for ncpd. Without this
       option, configure tries to automagically find a serial device.

  --with-speed=baudrate

       overrides the default serial speed of 115200 baud.

  --with-port=portnum

       overrides the default port number, where ncpd listens
       and plpftp resp. plpnfsd connects to.

  --with-drive=drivespec

       overrides the default drive for plpftp. The default "AUTO"
       triggers a drive-scan on the psion and sets the drive to
       the first drive found. If you don't want that, specify
       C: for example.

  --with-basedir=dirspec

       overrides the default directory for plpftp. The default is \\
       which means the root-dir. Note: directory-separators have to
       be specified as C-like backslashes and if you consider shell's
       escape-mechanism, these in turn have to be escaped with backslashes ;-)

  --disable-mnttab

       By default, configure checks for existence of /etc/mtab or /etc/mnttab
       and configures plpnfsd to update that file every time when it
       mounts or unmounts the psion. If plpnfsd crashes or is killed during
       that update, /etc/mtab resp. /etc/mnttab can be corrupted. Since
       this file on some operating systems is vital for functionality
       of mount/umount, this update can be disabled with the above option.

 By default, the install-prefix is /usr/local, so you probably
 should add /usr/local/lib to your /etc/ld.so.conf and then run
 ldconfig after installation. Another option is to run configure
 with the option --prefix=/usr

Have fun.
