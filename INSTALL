Installation instructions for plptools
--------------------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------

To build plpfuse, FUSE and libattr are required:

  http://fuse.sourceforge.net/
  ftp://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/download/

Development packages come with most Linux distributions.

If FUSE and libattr are not installed, plpfuse will not be built, but
the rest of plptools will still work.


Installation
------------

plptools uses GNU autotools, so the usual sequence of commands work:

./configure
make
make install

In addition to the usual options, configure understands the following
stuff for customization to your environment:

  --enable-debug

       Adds -g to CFLAGS, so you will get debugging-versions of the
       programs and libplp

  --with-serial=/dev/sometty

       overrides the default serial device for ncpd. Without this
       option, configure tries to automagically find a serial device.

  --with-speed=baudrate

       overrides the default serial speed of 115200 baud.

  --with-port=portnum

       overrides the default port number, where ncpd listens and
       plpftp and plpfuse connect to.

  --with-drive=drivespec

       overrides the default drive for plpftp. The default "AUTO"
       triggers a drive-scan on the psion and sets the drive to the
       first drive found. If you don't want that, specify C: for
       example.

  --with-basedir=dirspec

       overrides the default directory for plpftp. The default is \\
       which means the root-dir. Note: directory-separators have to be
       specified as C-like backslashes and if you consider shell's
       escape-mechanism, these in turn have to be escaped with
       backslashes ;-)

By default, the install-prefix is /usr/local, so you probably should
add /usr/local/lib to your /etc/ld.so.conf and then run ldconfig after
installation. Another option is to run configure with the option
--prefix=/usr


Information for developers
--------------------------

To build from CVS, you will first need to run

 autoreconf -i

To make a release automatically, you need woger, from
http://rrt.sc3d.org/Software/woger
