 * logbuf can be used, if you want to use syslog for
 * logging but don't want to change all your nice
 * C++-style output statements in your code.
 *
 * Here is an example showing the usage of logbuf:
 *
 * <PRE>
 *	openlog("myDaemon", LOG_CONS|LOG_PID, LOG_DAEMON);
 *	logbuf ebuf(LOG_ERR, 2);
 *	ostream lerr(&ebuf);
 *
 *	... some code ...
 *
 *	lerr << "Whoops, got an error" << endl;
 * </PRE>
 *
 * The second optional argument of the constructor can be used
 * to switch the output destination between syslog and some
 * file. If it is omitted or set to -1, logging can be switched on
 * or off. The initial state is on.
