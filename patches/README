The following patches may be applied to other programs to allow them to operate
better with plptools.

mgetty-1.1.21-plp.diff is from Christof Meerwald, and adds autodetection 
support for the PLP-protocol to mgetty - thus mgetty can autodetect a
Psion connected to the serial port and execute ncpd (with the autoexit
option). Having mgetty watch the serial port makes it a lot more easy to
switch between a PLP (file transfer) and a PPP (TCP/IP) connection. Christof
used the following login.conf for mgetty:

/AutoPPP/ -     -       /usr/sbin/pppd
/PLP/   -       -       /usr/sbin/ncpd -d -e
*       -       -       /bin/login @

linux-2.2.18-ttytap.patch is a patch for linux 2.2.18 adding a ttytap feature.
It enables you to sniff all data going in/out over a serial line. I use this
for sniffing communication between the Psion and a PsiWin running under Win98
in a vmware virtual machine. After applying this patch, you will find a new
option "Tty tapping" in the Section "Character devices" of the kernel
configuration. Enable this option and rebuild/install the kernel as usual.
When running the new kernel, you will find a new pseudo-device /proc/ttytap.
It implements various ioctl's and read. The userlevel program for dealing
with it can be found in etc/ttytap.c. Compile that and then run it e.g.:
ttytap /dev/ttyS0
