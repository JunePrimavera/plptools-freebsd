This directory provides some patches, i found useful when working with or
developing plptools.

1. MGETTY
mgetty-1.1.21-plp.diff is from Christof Meerwald, and adds autodetection 
support for the PLP-protocol to mgetty - thus mgetty can autodetect a
Psion connected to the serial port and execute ncpd (with the autoexit
option). Having mgetty watch the serial port makes it a lot more easy to
switch between a PLP (file transfer) and a PPP (TCP/IP) connection. Christof
used the following login.conf for mgetty:

/AutoPPP/ -     -       /usr/sbin/pppd
/PLP/   -       -       /usr/sbin/ncpd -d -e
*       -       -       /bin/login @

2. KDE libs
In stable kdelibs there is a bug which prevents all kioslaves from delivering
mime-types they know. Although this is fixed in KDE's CVS since some time now,
this fix did not made it into the latest maintenance release of kdelibs (2.1.2)
Therfore, you will _NOT_ see correct icons unless you apply kde-mimetype.patch
to kdelibs/kio/kfileitem.cpp and rebuild kdelibs. All other functionality -
especially that of kpsion and klipsi is _not_ affected.

3. KERNEL 2.2 (DEVELOPMENT ONLY)
linux-2.2.18-ttytap.patch is a patch for linux 2.2.18 adding a ttytap feature.
It enables you to sniff all data going in/out over a serial line. I use this
for sniffing communication between the Psion and a PsiWin running under Win98
in a vmware virtual machine. After applying this patch, you will find a new
option "Tty tapping" in the Section "Character devices" of the kernel
configuration. Enable this option and rebuild/install the kernel as usual.
When running the new kernel, you will find a new pseudo-device /proc/ttytap.
It implements various ioctl's and read. The userlevel program for dealing
with it can be found in etc/ttytap.c. Compile that and then run it e.g.:
ttytap /dev/ttyS0

My usual setup for sniffing PsiWin's PLP packets is this:
I have Win98 running under VMware under Linux with COM1 enabled via /dev/ttyS1.
First, i start ttytap /dev/ttyS1 > PsiWinSession.log
Then, i start VMware and in Win98 start PsiWin. Now i perform the actions
in PsiWin which i want to see in the log. After that, if terminate the
ttytap process. Now i have all the data of that session in PsiWinSession.log.
I have done a quickhack on Matt's ncpscope so it can read this file directly.

4. KERNEL 2.4 (same as above but for kernel 2.4)
