The following patches may be applied to other programs to allow them to operate
better with plptools.

mgetty-1.1.21-plp.diff is from Christof Meerwald, and adds autodetection 
support for the PLP-protocol to mgetty - thus mgetty can autodetect a
Psion connected to the serial port and execute ncpd (with the autoexit
option). Having mgetty watch the serial port makes it a lot more easy to
switch between a PLP (file transfer) and a PPP (TCP/IP) connection. Christof
used the following login.conf for mgetty:

/AutoPPP/ -     -       /usr/sbin/pppd
/PLP/   -       -       /usr/sbin/ncpd -d -e
*       -       -       /bin/login @
