Changes from Version 0.4 to 0.5:

 - merged all stuff from Matt Gumbley's plptools-0.4-mjg5
   see his README.mjg
 - Added a speedup-patch for plpnfsd from Rudol Koenig. This
   should also solve Olaf Flebbe's problems as a side effect.
 - Added command- and filename-completion to plpftp
 - Changed plpftp's default-drive to "AUTO". This triggers
   auto-detection of available drives and selecting the first one.
 - fixed various bugs in plpftp
 - added hash printing in plpftp.
 - Added new commands "ps", "kill" and "run" to plpftp (these should
   work at least for Series5. For Series3: INCOMPLETE)
