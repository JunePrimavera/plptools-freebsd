plptools (0.12-1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU upload (again) since Jon does not answer emails:
  (I cannot access the CVS server of plptools at sourceforge since it
   is down for maintenance so I don't know if this has been fixed
   upstream)
    - Fixed the Build-Depends and used --with-qt-dir=/usr/share/qt3 
      in debian/rules as suggested by KDE developer Ralf Nolden 
      (Closes: #189113)
    - Added the patch which fixes plbackup's unfriendly behavior of not
      printing an error if called with no arguments (Closes: #189135)
    - Added <cassert> to Enum in order for it to compile with g++ 3.3
    (the includes should be cleaned too since they use deprecated calls,
    upstream should do this -if not done already in CVS)

plptools (0.12-1.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * NMU upload since the maintainer cannot upload it himself.
  (after much struggling trying to get kdebase4 into my environment)
    - added John's Build-Depends for 0.12 (uses automake1.7)
    - Improved Build-Depends to avoid using versioning depends on
    automake use automake1.X instead (Closes: #175728)
    - added 0.11 changelog entries.
    - included 'fake' 0.12-1 entry
    - removes kde-config from plptools-dev (Closes: #173345)
    - Added the Homepage to all packages 
    - Added libqte-mt3-dev to Build-Depend, after a lot of issues 
    trying to make it compile in unstable
    (kdelibs4-dev pulls in libqte-mt3-dev and that one conflicts
    with libqt3-dev)
    - Modified m4 macros for QT detection and regerenated 
    aclocal.m4 to look for libqt properly and use -lqt-mt in Debian!
    (ugly hack which works with libqte-mt-dev)
    - Changed maintainer-clean to distclean in debian/rules (why
      was maintainer-clean done?)
    - Fixed psitime.cc use of Psitime::Psitime
    - Note: Be careful when compiling this package using libqte-mt-dev
    and make sure that /usr/bin/moc points to /usr/bin/moc-qt3 and not
    /usr/bin/moc-qt2 (otherwise it will _not_ compile)
    - Debian/rules no longer moves files which should be kept on debian/
    (still, I don't like the find done after the previous 'mv')
  * Based on new upstream version  which fixes a local root vulnerability
    (Closes: #178981)
  (Note to John: there were no .tar.gz or .diff.gz for the 0.12 version
  at http://www.paladin.demon.co.uk/packages/ so I had to take them
  from sourceforge and shake & mix with version in unstable and your .changes)
