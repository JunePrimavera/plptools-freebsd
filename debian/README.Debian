plptools for Debian
----------------------

Built from 1.08, downloaded from Sourceforge

This version defaults to connecting the Psion to /dev/ttyS0 - if you
connect to a different serial line you will need to change the plptools
init script (e.g. /etc/init.d/plptools if you use SV5 init)

Users who wish to use plpfuse should be added to the fuse group.
