Description: Access a Psion PDA over a serial link 
 This package lets you access Psion drives over a serial link. You
 can mount them, pseudo NFS style, access them FTP-like, use a local
 printer from the Psion (Psion S5 only) and perform backup/restore.
 .
 The software is partially based on p3nfs, which is also packed for
 Debian, but plptools uses the native Psion protocol, whereas p3nfs
 requires a program to be installed on the Psion.
