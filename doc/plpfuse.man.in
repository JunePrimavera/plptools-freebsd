.SH NAME
plpfuse \- Daemon to mount an EPOC device as a file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B plpfuse
.B [-V]
.B [-v]
.B [-h]
.BI "[-p [" host :] port ]
.BI [ long-options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
plpfuse is a file system which provides file system access to your EPOC device.
It mounts the EPOC device's file systems in to your computer's file system.
Like the other front-ends, this program
auto-reconnects after a link-failure, so you can keep the
EPOC device mounted all the time, even when it is not connected.
Due to Rudolf Koenig's clever error-handling, you don't need to
worry about blocked I/O-processes if the psion isn't available.
You simply will get an "device not configured" error, when
accessing a file on a previously connected psion which has been
disconnected. After that, the mount-point will appear with the
drives missing. As soon as the psion is connected again, the
subdirectories will reappear (possibly with a few seconds' delay).
