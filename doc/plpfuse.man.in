.SH NAME
plpfuse \- Daemon to mount an EPOC device as a file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B plpfuse
.B [-V]
.B [-d]
.B [-h]
.BI "[-p [" host :] port ]
.BI [ long-options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
plpfuse is a file system which provides file system access to your EPOC device.
It mounts the EPOC device's file systems in your computer's file system.
Like the other front-ends, this program
auto-reconnects after a link failure, so you can keep the
EPOC device mounted all the time, even when it is not connected.
Due to Rudolf Koenig's clever error handling, you don't need to
worry about blocked I/O processes if the psion isn't available.
You will simply get a "device not configured" error, when
accessing a file on a previously connected psion which has been
disconnected. After that, the mount point will appear with the
drives missing. As soon as the psion is connected again, the
subdirectories will reappear (possibly with a few seconds' delay).

EPOC file attributes are mapped as follows: readable on the EPOC
device is mapped to user-readable on UNIX; read-only is inverted and
mapped to user-writable; system, hidden and archived are mapped to
the extended user attribute
.B user.psion
as the single characters `s', `h' and `a'. The extended attribute can
therefore be up to three characters long. An attempt to read or write
any other extended attribute will give an error.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-V, --version
Display the version and exit
.TP
.B \-h, --help
Display a short help text and exit.
.TP
.B \-d, --debug
Produce debugging logs. Can be specified more than once to increase the
debug level (up to 3 times).
.TP
.BI "\-p, --port=[" host :] port
Specify the host and port to connect to (e.g. the port where ncpd is listening
on) - by default the host is 127.0.0.1 and the port is looked up in
/etc/services. If it is not found there, a fall-back builtin of
.I @DPORT@.

.SH BUGS
Because UNIX file names are simply byte strings, if your EPOC device
uses a different character set from the computer to which it is
connected, which is highly likely, then characters which are
differently encoded between the two characters sets will not translate
between the two systems. it is usually safe to use 7-bit ASCII
characters, avoiding colon (invalid on EPOC) and slash (invalid on
UNIX). This problem may be fixed in future.
