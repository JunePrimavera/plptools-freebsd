.SH NAME
plpnfsd \- Daemon to mount a Psion an nfs like filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B plpnfsd
.B [-V]
.B [-v]
.BI "[-p " port ]
.BI "[-d " mountdir ]
.BI "[-u " user ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
plpnfsd is a daemon, which provides NFS-like access to your Psion.
It automatically makes the psion's filesystems available below
an NFS-mounted directory (default /mnt/psion).
By default, plpnfsd is installed suid-root, so any normal user
can start it and get's the mounted directory owned by himself.
As this program is usually used on single-user machines, this
does not hurt security. Like the others, this program
auto-reconnects after a link-failure, so you can keep the
psion mounted all the time, even when it is not connected.
Due to Rudolf Koenig's clever error-handling, you don't need to
worry about blocked io-processes if the psion isn't available.
You simply will get an "device not configured" error, when
accessing a file on a previously connected psion which has been
disconnected. After that, the mount-point will appear empty.
As soon as the psion is connected again, the subdirectories
will reappear. (possibly with a few secs delay)
