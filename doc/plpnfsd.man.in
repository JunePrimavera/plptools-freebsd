.SH NAME
plpnfsd \- Daemon to mount a Psion like an NFS file-system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B plpnfsd
.B [-V]
.B [-v]
.B [-h]
.BI "[-p [" host :] port ]
.BI "[-d " mount-dir ]
.BI "[-u " user ]
.BI [ long-options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
plpnfsd is a daemon which provides NFS-like access to your Psion.
It automatically makes the Psion's file-systems available below
an NFS-mounted directory (default @DMOUNTPOINT@). It requires portmap.
By default, plpnfsd is installed suid root, so any normal user
can start it and gets the mounted directory owned by himself.
As this program is usually used on single-user machines, this
does not hurt security. Like the other front-ends, this program
auto-reconnects after a link-failure, so you can keep the
psion mounted all the time, even when it is not connected.
Due to Rudolf Koenig's clever error-handling, you don't need to
worry about blocked io-processes if the psion isn't available.
You simply will get an "device not configured" error, when
accessing a file on a previously connected psion which has been
disconnected. After that, the mount-point will appear with the
drives missing. As soon as the psion is connected again, the
subdirectories will reappear (possibly with a few seconds' delay).


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-V, --version
Display the version and exit
.TP
.B \-h, --help
Display a short help text and exit.
.TP
.B \-v, --verbose
Produce verbose logging output. Can be specified more than once to increase the
debug level (up to 3 times)
.TP
.BI "\-p, --port=[" host :] port
Specify the host and port to connect to (e.g. the port where ncpd is listening
on) - by default the host is 127.0.0.1 and the port is looked up in
/etc/services. If it is not found there, a fall-back builtin of
.I @DPORT@.
.TP
.BI "\-d, --mountpoint=" mount-dir
Specify the directory to mount the psion file system on. This defaults
to
.I @DMOUNTPOINT@
.TP
.BI "\-u, --user=" user
Specify the user who will own the psion files. This defaults to the user
who is running plpnfsd. If the user running plpnfsd is
.I root
, s/he may
also specify a different user.

.SH FILES
Below the special directory @DMOUNTPOINT@/proc there are several special
files which can be used to control plpnfsd and/or view some information
of the connected Psion.
.TP
@DMOUNTPOINT@/proc/exit
can be used to shutdown plpnfsd gracefully. To shutdown plpnfsd write
the string "stop" into that file.
.TP
@DMOUNTPOINT@/proc/owner
shows the Psion's owner information.
.TP
@DMOUNTPOINT@/proc/unixowner
The superuser (root) can set the owner of the mounted directory-tree
during runtime by writing the desired user-name into this file.
.TP
@DMOUNTPOINT@/proc/debuglevel
Reading/writing from/to this file shows resp. sets the debug level.
.TP
@DMOUNTPOINT@/proc/acache
Reading/writing from/to this file shows resp. sets the timeout value
for the attribute cache in seconds.
.TP
@DMOUNTPOINT@/proc/dcache
Reading/writing from/to this file shows resp. sets the timeout value
for the data cache in seconds.
.TP
@DMOUNTPOINT@/proc/<number>/cmd
Shows the name of the corresponding process on the Psion.
.TP
@DMOUNTPOINT@/proc/<number>/args
Shows the arguments of the corresponding process on the Psion.
