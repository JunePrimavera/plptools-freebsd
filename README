plptools is a suite of programs for transferring files to and from
EPOC devices, as well as backing them up, installing software, and
setting the clock. See INSTALL for installation instructions and
HISTORY for some history.

The programs include plpnfsd, which allows the EPOC device's filesystem
to be mounted in an NFS-like way (portmap is required for this).
