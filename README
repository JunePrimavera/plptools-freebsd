 This package is heavily based on two other packages:

   - p3nfsd-5.4 by Rudolf Koenig (rfkoenig@immd4.informatik.uni-erlangen.de)
     an nfs daemon for Psion series 3 and 5
   - plp_1_7 by Philip Proudman
	(former email, current address unknown proudman@btinternet.com)

 I want to thank both authors for their nice packages and for making
 these available under GPL which makes it possible for me to
 create this package (which of course is distributed under GPL ass well)

 What i did:

 I modified and improved Philip's code to support more (nearly all?)
 rfsv32 commands and to gain speed (approx 4 times) and stability
 (properly reconnects on lost serial link).
 Rudolf's code originally used a homegrown protocol which needs a
 separate program running on the Psion. I changed his code to use
 the socket-based client-code from Philip's rfsv program thus
 eliminating the need for any software beeing run on the Psion.
 The rfsv code and some other stuff went into a lib (both shared
 and static available). I also removed all Psion-3 related stuff,
 because a) i can't test it and b) Sibo support is dropped by
 Psion.

 How to install:

 ./configure
 make
 make install

 In addition to the ususal options (see INSTALL), configure
 understands the following stuff for customization to your
 environment:

  --enable-debug

       Adds -g to CFLAGS, so you will get debugging-versions of
       the programs and libplp

  --with-serial=/dev/sometty

       overrides the default serial device for ncpd. Without this
       option, configure tries to automagically find a serial device.

  --with-speed=baudrate

       overrides the default serial speed of 115200 baud.

  --with-port=portnum

       overrides the default port number, where ncpd listens
       and plpftp resp. plpnfsd connects to.

 You will get 3 programs and a shared and static library.
 By default, the install-prefix is /usr/local, so you probably
 should add /usr/local/lib to your /etc/ld.so.conf and then run
 ldconfig after installation. Another option is to run configure
 with the option --prefix=/usr

 The programs:

 ncpd is the daemon which handles the serial link to your Psion.
 It listens at port 7501 for local connections and provides
 basic PLP/NCP services for the other two programs. It auto-
 connects to the psion, even after unplugging/switching off
 therefore it can run always in background (if you have a
 spare serial-device)

 plpftp is a FTP-like program for manipulating files on the Psion.

 plpnfsd is a daemon, which provides NFS-like access to your Psion.
 It automatically makes the psion's filesystems available below
 an NFS-mounted directory (default /mnt/psion).
 By default, plpnfsd is installed suid-root, so any normal user
 can start it and get's the mounted directory owned by himself.
 As this program is usually used on single-user machines, this
 does not hurt security. Like the others, this program
 auto-reconnects after a link-failure, so you can keep the
 psion mounted all the time, even when it is not connected.
 Due to Rudol Koenig's clever error-handling, you don't need to
 worry about blocked io-processes if the psion isn't available.
 You simply will get an "device not configured" error, when
 accessing a file on a previously connected psion which has been
 disconnected. After that, the mount-point will appear empty.
 As soon as the psion is connected again, the subdirectories
 will reappear. (possibly with a few secs delay)

Have fun.
