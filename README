 This package is heavily based on two other packages:

   - p3nfsd-5.4 by Rudolf Koenig (rfkoenig@immd4.informatik.uni-erlangen.de)
     an nfs daemon for Psion series 3 and 5
   - plp_1_7 by Philip Proudman (phil@proudman51.freeserve.co.uk)

 I want to thank both authors for their nice packages and for making
 these available under GPL which makes it possible for me to
 create this package (which of course is distributed under GPL ass well)

 What i did:

 I modified and improved Philip's code to support more (nearly all?)
 rfsv32 commands and to gain speed (approx 4 times) and stability
 (properly reconnects on lost serial link).
 Rudolf's code originally used a homegrown protocol which needs a
 separate program running on the Psion. I changed his code to use
 the socket-based client-code from Philip's rfsv program thus
 eliminating the need for any software beeing run on the Psion.
 The rfsv code and some other stuff went into a lib (both shared
 and static available). I also removed all Psion-3 related stuff,
 because a) i can't test it and b) Sibo support is dropped by
 Psion.

 Since version 0.5, there is also starting support for RPC-service
 on the Psion. Note the new commands "ps", "kill" and "run" in
 plpftp. This support was only possible because of Alexander Thoukydides'
 excellent documentation at
 http://www.btinternet.com/~thouky/software/psifs/plp.html
 Thanks a lot for that. Also Psion-3 support is now added by Matt Gumbley
 (matt@gumbley.demon.co.uk)

 How to install:

 ./configure
 make
 make install

 In addition to the ususal options (see INSTALL), configure
 understands the following stuff for customization to your
 environment:

  --enable-debug

       Adds -g to CFLAGS, so you will get debugging-versions of
       the programs and libplp

  --with-serial=/dev/sometty

       overrides the default serial device for ncpd. Without this
       option, configure tries to automagically find a serial device.

  --with-speed=baudrate

       overrides the default serial speed of 115200 baud.

  --with-port=portnum

       overrides the default port number, where ncpd listens
       and plpftp resp. plpnfsd connects to.

  --with-drive=drivespec

       overrides the default drive for plpftp. The default "AUTO"
       triggers a drive-scan on the psion and sets the drive to
       the first drive found. If you don't want that, specify
       C: for example.

  --with-basedir=dirspec

       overrides the default directory for plpftp. The default is \\
       which means the root-dir. Note: directory-separators have to
       be specified as C-like backslashes and if you consider shell's
       escape-mechanism, these in turn have to be escaped with backslashes ;-)

  --disable-mnttab

       By default, configure checks for existence of /etc/mtab or /etc/mnttab
       and configures plpnfsd to update that file every time when it
       mounts or unmounts the psion. If plpnfsd crashes or is killed during
       that update, /etc/mtab resp. /etc/mnttab can be corrupted. Since
       this file on some operating systems is vital for functionality
       of mount/umount, this update can be disabled with the above option.

  --enable-kde

       Enable build of KDE related stuff. This needs installed
       KDE (>= 2) headers/development-libraries as well as QT (>= 2.2.4)
       headers/development-libraries.

  --with-kdedir=/path/to/your/kde

       Specify the KDE directory. I got several reports from SuSE users,
       who have KDE1 and KDE2 in those weird pathes /opt/kde and /opt/kde2
       installed and the automatic detection does get confused by that.
       So be shure to use this switch. RedHat users can safely use
       --prefix=/usr instead.

  --with-qt-dir=/path/to/your/qtdir

   or 

  --with-qt-includes=/path/to/your/qt-headers
  --with-qt-libraries=/path/to/your/qt-lib

      Same as above. Use these, when automatic detection fails.

  --with-kdeversion=X

       Override the KDE version detection manually. Only needed in
       special cases where more than one KDE version is installed and
       autodetection fails. X can be either 2 or 3.

 You will get 6 programs and a shared and static library (in
 case you enabled KDE: 8 Programs 4 shared libraries).
 By default, the install-prefix is /usr/local, so you probably
 should add /usr/local/lib to your /etc/ld.so.conf and then run
 ldconfig after installation. Another option is to run configure
 with the option --prefix=/usr

 NOTE:
 Although the subdirectory for KDE stuff is named "kde2", this is only
 for historical reason. The package builds on KDE2 as well as KDE3.
 It tries to figure out the version of KDE automatically. People who have
 both versions installed should carefully watch the output of configure.
 The KDEDIR as well as KDE's version can be overridden via commandline
 (see above).

 IMPORTANT NOTE about the following descriptions:
 Please read the man pages ncpd(8) plpftp(1), plpnfsd(8) plpprintd(8),
 sisinstall(1) and plpbackup(1)! The information there is more up-to-date.

 The programs:

 NCPD

 ncpd is the daemon which handles the serial link to your Psion.
 It listens at port 7501 for local connections and provides
 basic PLP/NCP services for the other two programs. It auto-
 connects to the psion, even after unplugging/switching off
 therefore it can run always in background (if you have a
 spare serial-device). If supplied, the -e option will cause ncpd to
 automatically exit when the connection to the Psion is lost. This is useful
 when used with a patch to mgetty (see the patches directory).

 PLPFTP

 plpftp is a FTP-like program for manipulating files on the Psion.

 SISINSTALL

 Sisinstall, written by Daniel Brahneborg (basic@chello.se) installs a
 SIS file on the connected psion. It is in very early development, but
 it seems to work fine for simple packages.

 PLPBACKUP

 Is a program for backup/restore of your Psion (same functionality
 like KPsion, but command-line version, not depending on QT, KDE or X11)

 PLPNFSD
 plpnfsd is a daemon, which provides NFS-like access to your Psion.
 It automatically makes the psion's filesystems available below
 an NFS-mounted directory (default /mnt/psion).
 By default, plpnfsd is installed suid-root, so any normal user
 can start it and get's the mounted directory owned by himself.
 As this program is usually used on single-user machines, this
 does not hurt security. Like the others, this program
 auto-reconnects after a link-failure, so you can keep the
 psion mounted all the time, even when it is not connected.
 Due to Rudol Koenig's clever error-handling, you don't need to
 worry about blocked io-processes if the psion isn't available.
 You simply will get an "device not configured" error, when
 accessing a file on a previously connected psion which has been
 disconnected. After that, the mount-point will appear empty.
 As soon as the psion is connected again, the subdirectories
 will reappear. (possibly with a few secs delay)

 PLPPRINTD
 A daemon for printing via PC from your Psion.

 KDE STUFF

 The KDE KIOslave library adds support for a new protocol named
 "psion:". So in konqueror, just open psion:/ to see your Psion's
 drives. You now can copy, move, rename, open ... all those
 operations you are used to. Any KDE application which supports
 URLs should be able to deal with the files on the Psion.
 If you have the toplevel directory displayed in Konqueror, the
 Property dialog for the drives (right-click on an icon of a
 drive, Properties) comes up in a modified fashion which allows
 you to see the drive usage as well as triggering backup, restore
 and format. The toplevel Properties (right-click on the view's
 background, Properties) brings up a Dialog which displays machine-
 related information. (Same info like the "machinfo" command in
 plpftp. Currently there are no mime-types for Psion-Files but i
 soon will add these. Backup, restore and format is done by a separate
 standalone program "KPsion".

Have fun.
