 This package is heavily based on two other packages:

   - p3nfsd-5.4 by Rudolf Koenig (rfkoenig@immd4.informatik.uni-erlangen.de)
     an nfs daemon for Psion series 3 and 5
   - plp_1_7 by Philip Proudman
	(former email, current address unknown proudman@btinternet.com)

 I want to thank both authors for their nice packages and for making
 these available under GPL which makes it possible for me to
 create this package (which of course is also distributed under GPL)

 What i did:

 I modified and improved Philip's code to support more (nearly all?)
 rfsv32 commands and to gain speed (approx 4 times) and stability
 (properly reconnects on lost serial link).
 Rudolf's code originally used a homegrown protocol which needs a
 separate program running on the Psion. I changed his code to use
 the socket-based client-code from Philip's rfsv program thus
 eliminating the need for any software beeing run on the Psion. 
 The rfsv code and some other stuff went into a lib (both shared
 and static available). I also removed all Psion-3 related stuff,
 because a) i can't test it and b) Sibo support is dropped by
 Psion.

 How to install:

 ./configure
 make
 make install

 In addition to the ususal options (see INSTALL), configure
 understands the following stuff for customization to your
 environment:

  --enable-debug

       Adds -g to CFLAGS, so you will get debugging-versions of
       the programs and libplp

  --with-serial=/dev/sometty

       overrides the default serial device for ncpd. Without this
       option, configure tries to automagically find a serial device.

  --with-speed=baudrate

       overrides the default serial speed of 115200 baud.

  --with-port=portnum

       overrides the default port number, where ncpd listens
       and plpftp resp. plpnfsd connects to.

 You will get 3 programs and a shared and static library.
 By default, the install-prefix is /usr/local, so you probably
 should add /usr/local/lib to your /etc/ld.so.conf and then run
 ldconfig after installation.

 The programs:

 ncpd is the daemon which handles the serial link to your Psion.
 It listens at port 7501 for local connections and provides
 basic PLP/NCP services for the other two programs.

 plpftp is a FTP-like program for manipulating files on the Psion.

 plpnfsd is a daemon, which provides NFS-like access to your Psion.

Have fun.
