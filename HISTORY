 This package is heavily based on two other packages:

   - p3nfsd-5.4 by Rudolf Koenig (rfkoenig@immd4.informatik.uni-erlangen.de)
     an nfs daemon for Psion series 3 and 5
   - plp_1_7 by Philip Proudman (phil@proudman51.freeserve.co.uk)

 I want to thank both authors for their nice packages and for making
 these available under GPL which makes it possible for me to
 create this package (which of course is distributed under GPL as well)

 What i did:

 I modified and improved Philip's code to support more (nearly all?)
 rfsv32 commands and to gain speed (approx 4 times) and stability
 (properly reconnects on lost serial link).
 Rudolf's code originally used a homegrown protocol which needs a
 separate program running on the Psion. I changed his code to use
 the socket-based client-code from Philip's rfsv program thus
 eliminating the need for any software beeing run on the Psion.
 The rfsv code and some other stuff went into a lib (both shared
 and static available). I also removed all Psion-3 related stuff,
 because a) i can't test it and b) Sibo support is dropped by
 Psion.

 Since version 0.5, there is also starting support for RPC-service
 on the Psion. Note the new commands "ps", "kill" and "run" in
 plpftp. This support was only possible because of Alexander Thoukydides'
 excellent documentation at
 http://www.btinternet.com/~thouky/software/psifs/plp.html
 Thanks a lot for that. Also Psion-3 support is now added by Matt Gumbley
 (matt@gumbley.demon.co.uk)

Have fun.
